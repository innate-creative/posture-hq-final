      <h2> Dr. Liz Borham </h2>
      <h4> (Chiropractor) </h4>
      <p>Dr Liz discovered Chiropractic at the age of 30, after seeking help for asthma with which she had struggled since early childhood.  Little did she know back then that seeing a Chiropractor would transform her life, not only in terms of her health but also in her career. <br> <br>
      Liz has a varied history, working as an economist, an IT consultant, running a florist shop and as a Chiropractic receptionist. She completed her Chiropractic training in 2013, graduating with distinction among the top of her class from RMIT University in Melbourne.<br> <br>
      Liz sees her role as a Chiropractor as being a partner with people who want to achieve health and wellness goals.  Her aim is to have people of all ages feeling and functioning as well as they can. She loves Chiropractic for its focus on health from the 'inside out' and she loves ABC for its powerful, consistent, measurable results.  Liz has trained with world leaders in ABC technique both in Australia and internationally and takes pride in continually refining her skills.<br> <br>
      Outside of the Chiropractic clinic, Liz is a mummy to two beautiful girls and a wife to the amazing Gary.  She loves Bikram yoga, crochet, taking dance classes and swimming at the Sunshine Coast's amazing beaches. </p>
