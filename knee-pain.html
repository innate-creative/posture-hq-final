    <p> Knee pain is very prevalent in society, especially among athletes and the weekend warriors.</p>
    <p> There are many different causes and types of knee pain. From arthritis, patella tracking dysfunctions, tendinitis, ligament tears, cartilage and meniscus damage, bursitis, baker’s cysts just to name a few. </p>
    <p>At Posture HQ Chiropractic in Noosa, we recognise that the body doesn’t work in isolation but that everything is connected and works as a single unit. With this understanding we treat knee pain from a holistic approach, working not just with your knee but your entire body.</p>
    <p>How does forward posture contribute to knee pain?  </p>
    <p>Your centre of gravity should be inline with your ankles and knees. If your centre of gravity shifts forwards, as seen in the below photos your knee has to take a lot more pressure. The ligaments around the joint become tight and the cartilage becomes compressed. </p>
    <p>When your posture is upright and balanced it means your knees are distributing your body weight evenly as nature intended. Reducing the pressure and tension placed on the knee joint, allowing old injuries to heal and your knee to function optimally. </p>
