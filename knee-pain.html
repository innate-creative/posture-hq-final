      Knee pain is very prevalent in society, especially among athletes and the weekend warriors.
    </p>
    <p class="editable">
      There are many different causes and types of knee pain. From arthritis, patella tracking dysfunctions, tendinitis, ligament tears, cartilage and meniscus damage, bursitis and baker&rsquo;s cysts, to name a few.
    </p>
    <p class="editable">
      At PostureHQ we recognise that the body doesn&rsquo;t work in isolation but that everything is connected and works as a single unit. With this understanding we treat knee pain from a holistic approach, working not just with your knee but your entire body.

      How does forward posture contribute to knee pain?
    </p>
    <p class="editable">
      Your centre of gravity should be in line with your ankles and knees. If your centre of gravity shifts forwards, your knee has to take a lot more pressure. The ligaments around the joint become tight and the cartilage becomes compressed.
    </p>
    <p class="editable">
      When your posture is upright and balanced, it means your knees are distributing your body weight evenly as nature intended - reducing the pressure and tension placed on the knee joint, allowing old injuries to heal, and your knee to function optimally.
