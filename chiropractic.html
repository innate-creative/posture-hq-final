      About ABC&trade;
    </h2>
    <p class="editable">
      Advanced BioStructural Correction&trade; (ABC&trade;) is a new approach to chiropractic and healthcare. It is very different from traditional chiropractic methods. ABC&trade; has a unique focus on structural alignment of the bones of your body. Research is emerging showing the link between posture and health, both physical and emotional.
    </p>
    <p class="editable">
      If a bone is knocked out of place, it will be detected by the body as a shift in structural alignment. It will then use muscles to pull the misaligned bone back into the correct position. The body&rsquo;s ability to correct these misaligned bones helps you stay healthy. Yet, if the body had the ability to correct every type of misaligned bone, would the human body even have any form of musculoskeletal conditions? Most likely not.

      How do problems start?
    </h2>
    <p class="editable">
      ABC&trade; recognises that if a bone gets knocked out of place in one particular direction, there are no muscles in the opposite direction to pull the misaligned bone back into its optimal structure. This is something that the human body has no ability to fix - a design flaw of sorts.
    </p>
    <p class="editable">
      When a bone gets knocked out of place in a direction that the body has no ability to self-correct, it places a large amount of mechanical stress and tension on the body, brain and nervous system.
    </p>
    <p class="editable">
      This reduces the body's ability to heal and function. The body now has to compensate for this problem that it cannot self-correct, so it will lean, twist, bend and pull various muscles and joints to restore alignment to the best of its ability.
    </p>
    <p class="editable">
      This then creates a layer of compensatory twist throughout the entire body and, with each bone that has been knocked out of place in a direction the body cannot self-correct, another layer of compensatory twist develops.
    </p>
    <p class="editable">
      Over time, these compensatory layers of twist build up on top of each other. The resultant layers of twist begin to put mechanical stress and tension on the body leading to slumped, twisted, forward and locked postures. These result in many secondary structural conditions.

      ABC&trade; before and after photos
    </h2>
    <img src="/images/abc-posture-results.jpg" class='center editable' alt="Posture HQ Chiropractic Results" />
    <p class="editable">
      These photos were taken before and after an Advanced BioStructural Correction&trade; (ABC&trade;) adjustment. The participants were volunteers who had not been adjusted with ABC&trade; before. The only other selection criteria was their availability. The instructions for each photo were the same: &ldquo;breathe in, breathe out, relax and let your body slump&rdquo;. The ABC&trade; adjustment was the only intervention between the before and after photos and all photographic conditions remained the same. In each photo pair, black lines were added in consistent positions for the purpose of easier comparison. A total of six participants were adjusted - all showed improvements in sagittal plane posture. These were considered the best four.

      Our practice focus
    </h2>
    <p class="editable">
      At PostureHQ, we focus on correcting the misalignments that your body has no ability to correct itself by using the Advanced BioStructural Correction&trade; method. ABC&trade; is highly effective at treating many musculoskeletal conditions. We utilise postural photo analysis, X-rays where applicable, and evidenced based Y-Balance and Functional Movement Screenings to determine our approach to care.
    </p>
    <p class="editable">
      The ABC&trade; treatment approach uses stretches and adjustments of the spine, pelvis, knees, ankles and feet. Only certain areas of the body are adjusted. As ABC&trade; targets these particular misalignments, your body can progressively let go and unlock these layers of compensatory twist in a process known as &lsquo;unwinding&rsquo;. With ABC&trade;, your body regains its structural alignment and begins to function optimally again. Postural changes can often be noticed even after the first few adjustments.
    </p>
    <p class="editable">
      ABC&trade; is results focused. We use progressive posture photos to monitor your progress over time to ensure your goals are being met.
