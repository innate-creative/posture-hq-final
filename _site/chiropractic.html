    <h2> About ABC™ </h2>
    <p>Advanced BioStructural Correction™ (ABC) is a new approach to chiropractic and healthcare. It is very different from traditional chiropractic methods. ABC has a very unique focus on structural alignment of the bones of your body. The structural alignment of the bones in your body is critical to health and wellness. Through various knocks, bumps, injuries, prolonged sitting and poor sleeping positions, these traumas have the ability to knock bones out of place.</p>
    <p>Most of these bones, if knocked out of place, will be detected by the body as a shift in structural alignment. It will then use muscles to pull the misaligned bone back into the correct position. The body’s ability to correct these misaligned bones helps you stay healthy. Yet, if the body had the ability to correct every type of misaligned bone, would the human body even have any form of musculoskeletal conditions? Most likely not.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="col-12 padded">
    <p>ABC recognises that there is one particular direction that if a bone gets knocked out of place, there are no muscles in the opposite direction to pull the misaligned bone back into its optimal structure. This is something that the human body has no ability to fix - a design flaw of sorts.</p>
    <p>When a bone gets knocked out of place in a direction that the body has no ability to self correct, it places a large amount of mechanical stress and tension on the body, brain and nervous system.</p>
    <p>This reduces the body's ability to heal and function. The body now has to compensate for this problem that it cannot self-correct, so it will lean, twist, bend and pull various muscles and joints to restore alignment to the best of its ability.</p>
    <p>This then creates a layer of compensatory twist throughout the entire body and with each bone that has been knocked out of place in a direction the body cannot self-correct, another layer of compensatory twist develops.</p>
    <p>Over time, these compensatory layers of twist build up on top of each other. The resultant layers of twist begin to put mechanical stress and tension on the body leading to slumped, twisted, forward and locked postures. These result in many secondary structural conditions …</p>

    <h2> Our Practice Focus </h2>
    <p> At Posture HQ, we focus on correcting the misalignments that your body has no ability to correct itself by using the Advanced BioStructural Correction method.
    ABC is highly effective at treating many musculoskeletal conditions. We utilise postural photo analysis, X-rays where applicable and evidenced based Y-Balance and Functional Movement Screenings to determine our approach to care.</p>
    <p>The ABC treatment approach uses stretches and adjustments of the spine, pelvis, knees, ankles and feet. Only the bones that are misaligned in a direction your body has no ability to correct will be adjusted.</p>
    <p>As ABC targets these particular misalignments, your body can progressively let go and unlock these layers of compensatory twist in a process known as ‘unwinding’. With ABC, your body regains its structural alignment and begins to function optimally again. Postural changes can often be noticed even after the first few adjustments.</p>
    <p>We use progressive posture photos, lung capacity tests and the Y-Balance testing to monitor your progress over time to ensure your goals are being met.</p>
