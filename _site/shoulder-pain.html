    <h4> SHOULDER PAIN, FROZEN SHOULDER AND POOR SHOULDER MOBILITY ARE AMONG ONE OF THE MOST COMMON PRESENTATIONS TO POSTURE HQ.</h4>
    <p> Shoulder pain and poor posture are directly related. If your shoulders roll forward when you let your body slump or your shoulders naturally sit forward you are at risk of having shoulder issues.</p>

The shoulder joint is known as a ball and socket joint, the head of the humerus sits in the glenoid fossa of the shoulder blade. The shoulder joint is surrounded by many muscles, commonly referred to as the rotator cuff group. The rotator cuff consists of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis.

The job of these muscles is to contract to provide movement in a variety of different directions of the shoulder. The shoulder is capable of movement in practically every plane thanks to the structure of this ball and socket joint, and the rotator cuff muscles.

When your posture is forward, twisted, slouched or locked, the alignment of the shoulder joint rolls forward. You can test this on your self; take a deep breath in, breathe out, relax and let your body slump. Did your shoulders roll forward? If yes, this means that your shoulder joint is unstable. The degrees of this vary as do peoples symptoms.  As a result of this instability of the shoulder joint, the body will compensate by contracting muscles around the shoulder joint to provide stability. This leads to sprains and strains of the rotator cuff and even through chronic overuse in this contracted state can lead to rotator cuff tears.

The increase in mechanical tension and pressure of the shoulders can also cause impingement of the bursa in the shoulder, known as the subacromial bursa. This can often cause inflammation and pain often referred to as a condition known as shoulder bursitis.

At Posture HQ, we take a unique approach to helping you with your shoulder problems. Traditional physiotherapy, chiropractic and other physical therapies focus on the contracted muscles by stretching them and then strengthening them. Rightly so, as these muscles are why your shoulder hurts or create the limited mobility. Yet the results can be short-lived.

Using a method known as Advanced BioStructural Correction we correct the underlying cause of these shoulder issues, which is a structural alignment of your body and shoulder. When this occurs the muscles and rotator cuff do not have a need to compensate for your unstable shoulder anymore. This results in not only symptomatic relief of pain but greater mobility and overall function of the shoulder and the body as a whole. </p>
