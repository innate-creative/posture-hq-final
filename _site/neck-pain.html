    <h4> POOR POSTURE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST UNDERLYING CAUSES OF NECK PAIN. </h4>
    <p> Neck pain is the result of muscles, ligaments, tendons, bones and discs being under constant strain and pressure. Neck pain is one of the most common conditions people present to Posture HQ needing help with.

The human head weighs approximately 4.5kg - kg. If you head falls forward of your centre of gravity the muscles surrounding your head and neck will contract to hold your head up. This creates overuse of these tissues which is what causes pain and tension through the neck. Many people ‘who carry their stress’ in their neck often have a forward head carriage or forward head posture.

For most who have this forward head posture with neck pain, referred tension headaches become a common problem also. (see section on Headaches)

Traditional approaches to neck pain focus only on the tight muscles and tissues of the neck. This tends to provide only temporary relief. Eventually the muscles will again get tight and painful as they continue to compensate for the forward head posture.

At Posture HQ Chiropractic in Noosa Heads, we understand the mechanics of the body as well as anyone. Using a new method of chiropractic known as Advanced BioStructural Correction or ABC for short we are able to correct your underlying poor forward posture which allows the muscles, ligaments, bones and discs which are under constant tension to finally relax. By correcting the underlying poor posture, we have great success with clients of all ages with neck pain, often providing permanent relief of pain.
These below photos show before and after photos of actual cases. These photos were taken directly after one ABC adjustment. As you can see in these below images each of the participants showed a reduction in the forward head posture. </p>
